Navigation is one of the core components of any mobile robotic system, and robust navigation strategies are required in order to accomplish more advanced tasks. Robots are now starting to operate outside of controlled laboratory, factory, and warehouse settings, which has required a large leap in capabilities as robots must now contend with highly cluttered and dynamic environments filled with people, who are inherently difficult to model, and with other robots, who they may not be able to communicate with.

Solutions to this problem involve a myriad of disciplines, from multi-modal perception to detect and classify individual objects, multi-target tracking to track these objects over time, trajectory prediction to enumerate possible future actions of each object, and (multi-robot) planning algorithms that can account for these possible actions. We will invite experts in each of these sub-communities to discuss recent results and trends in each of these domains and to discuss best practices for their integration in order to yield robust navigation systems that function in the most challenging environments.

Relevant topics include: perception, multi-target tracking, trajectory prediction, AV planning, multi- robot planning
